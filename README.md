# Employee-Tracker

Node.js command-line application to query database for employees working within a company. This allows the business owner to keep track and manage the departments, roles, and employees in the company.

## Installation and Usage

Run the following command to install all dependencies:

npm i

For security you will need to create a .env file in the root directory to store your database credentials. This file should contain the information as follows:

DB_HOST=xxx
DB_USER=xxx
DB_PASS=xxx

Once completed, navigate to the root of the project and run the following command:

node server.js

You will then be prompted with a menu where you can then select the option you wish. After selecting some options, you may be given more prompts to narrow down your selection.
