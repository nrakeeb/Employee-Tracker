For security you will need to create a .env file in the root directory to store your database credentials. This file should contain the information as follows:

DB_HOST=xxx

DB_PASS=xxx

Once completed, navigate to the root of the project and run the following command:

node server.js

You will then be prompted with a menu where you can then select the option you wish. After selecting some options, you may be given more prompts to narrow down your selection.
